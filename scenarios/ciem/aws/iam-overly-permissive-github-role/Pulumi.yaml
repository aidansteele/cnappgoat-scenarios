description: This scenario creates an IAM OpenID Connect provider for Github.com 
  and a role that trusts it without sufficient trust policy conditions. This exposes
  your account to confused deputy attacks. To fix, include the condition 
  "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub" in your IAM role trust policy during 
  the creation process.
